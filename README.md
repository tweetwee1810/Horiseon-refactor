In the HTML, using properly semantic tags will make HTML more comprehensive that helps defining the different sections and layout for the webpage.

Adding the **nav class= header** semantic tag in order to create a nagivation bar. 

Adding three separate **section** element for each heading of the webpage. 

Adding **header** element under the **body** element to help defined the header for this section as it contains the three big heading for the webpage. 

Adding **alt** attribute will help provided information about the image that the viewer cannot be able to see. 

In the CSS, organizing or consolidating the formatting, and images properties is important. All of the same format elements should put together, so the team members will easy to keep track and maintainable. 
There are five formattings needed to be consolidated in the CSS. 

First of all, benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost have the same margin-bottom and color, they should consolidate into the same section instead of make each of them with the similar format.
Similarly, other images properties and other formatting are also needed to be consolidated in the same section.
